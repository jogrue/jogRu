# jogRu
jogRu is an R package for a bunch of functions I wrote during working with R. They are intended for my personal usage, but perhaps you find some of it useful.

It is installed from within R using [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools):

```R
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("jogrue/jogRu")
```
